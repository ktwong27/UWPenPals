}

NOTES:
    The first 9 fields here must appear in this order, and therefore must be the first 9 questions in your Google Form.
    Each field is an array with the following values
        [ INDEX, TYPE, WEIGHT ]
    INDEX is the index of the attribute for each response
    TYPE has 3 possible values:
        0 : data
        1 : multiple choice
        2 : short answer, simple
        3 : short answer, open ended
    WEIGHT is how much you want that attribute to affect the rating of any particular match
        If data is not used for matching, no need to include WEIGHT
